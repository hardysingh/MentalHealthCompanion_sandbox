5,"My wife took me here on my birthday for breakfast and it was excellent. The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure. Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning. It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better. Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary. It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had. I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it. It was amazing. While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious. It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete. It was the best ""toast"" I've ever had. Anyway, I can't wait to go back!"
5,"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that. In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small ""Here's The Beef"" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11"" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce! We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues."
5,"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more. The food is that good. This cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction. While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the ""Grand Opening"" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy! A new place to try! It looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside. I ordered dinner for two, to go. The menu was awesome. I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves. It made it difficult to choose something. Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco. They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show. So much flavor. I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight. The salsa bar is endless. I really stocked up. I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious. They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus! As if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did! I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah. There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing. All the paintings are great, love the artist."
5,Nobuo shows his unique talents with everything on the menu. Carefully crafted features with much to drink. Start with the pork belly buns and a stout. Then go on until you can no longer.
5,Here's the lowdown: Giant ice cream cookie sandwiches for super cheap. The flavor permutations are basically endless. I had snickerdoodle with cookies and cream ice cream. It was marvelous.
5,Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises.
5,"Probably THE best BBQ Chicken pizza I have ever had. I have tried other things too, like the tomato basil soup, and many of their sandwiches ... very good, very fresh - every time. The 5 stars is for the pizza, but if I were to rate Jason's Deli over all they would get about a 4."
5,"okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!"
4,"the focus on fresh food and a great breakfast has build a strong following at this destination location in Scottsdale Civic Center. now that i think about it how can i not give this place a 5 stars theirs way to much creativity and freshnewssness in the fruit, veg and the nectar of the gods, Coffee, all packed into one nice bright orange place. \n\nOld Town has a few breakfast spots but this is one you have to find. can i say I hope to see this as a Scottsdale yelp ""hidden gem.""\n\nAs for my last meal I had the prosciutto melt and it went past expectations, the fresh basil really added the extra taste. \n\nService was ok, a typical cafe style, the restaurant does not seek to be over pertinacious, the look is clean and the cafe is a really nice touch with options to order and go."
4,"A definite favorite in the neighborhood. The happy hour menu is always interesting and good. In several visits I've never had anything that wasn't delicious, and the beers on special are uniformly impressive."
4,Service could be a little quicker. Bring cash if you're spending less than $5 - with pho and water you will pay 3.50 + tax.  Cheapest lunch in town.
3,"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out."
3,Affordable and good. Clean restaurant. Will return.
3,"Sacks is a great little place. One issue and I know this wouldn't seem like a bad thing (at least if you are the owner) but it is a bit too busy for me. I can never find a parking place or a seat. The sandwiches are good and I like them, but I will admit that sometimes I don't go just because of the crowds. The food is good.  I like that they have a variety of sandwhiches and they put a lot of things on the sandwiches which can easily be taken off for the picky folks like me unlike other places where things are mixed in and not removable.  If you are looking for a good tasty sandwhich, this is a great place to check out.  If you are looking for a nice relaxing lunch where you can find a seat, move along."
2,"Bland and lackluster food that is not worth the price or the wait to get it. We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago. I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash. As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had. The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for. My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. "
2,"Dropped by for a manicure, and as soon as I sat down, my manicurist started talking in rapid Vietnamese. I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it. The whole experience was perfunctory, but didn't leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didn't see what they looked like!"
2,"I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Panda's. If it wasn't across the street from work, I wouldn't go here at all. Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch. I'm not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank."
1,"Where are the managers???? It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening. Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time. The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends. Waitress just took it away and did not comp us. Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu. She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables. Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud. One of the worst dining experiences in a long time. Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry. HORRIBLE!"
1,"Still quite poor both in service and food. maybe I made a mistake and ordered Sichuan Gong Bao ji ding for what seemed like people from canton district. Unfortunately to get the good service U have to speak Mandarin/Cantonese. I do speak a smattering but try not to use it as I never feel confident about the intonation. The dish came out with zichini and bell peppers (what!??)  Where is the peanuts the dried fried red peppers and the large pieces of scallion. On pointing this out all I got was "" Oh you like peanuts.. ok I will put some on"" and she then proceeded to get some peanuts and sprinkle it on the chicken."
1,"First, I hope La Fonda management reads these reviews and takes steps to improve their restaurant. Second, we miss the bloody mary bar too. Hubby & I visited LF a few weeks ago on a Saturday night for dinner. We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong. Okay, she doesn't know beer. We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water. What the? I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird. The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice. Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it. My meal was not memorable either. I wanted to love this place, or at least like it. We walked out of there terribly disappointed, I doubt we'll go back."
